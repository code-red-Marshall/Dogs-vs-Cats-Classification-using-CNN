# Cats vs Dogs Classification using CNN

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project for classifying images of cats and dogs. The model is trained to accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can classify images of cats and dogs. The project involves several key steps including data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Images are resized and normalized to improve model performance.
- **CNN Architecture:** A robust CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from images.
- **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained using a large dataset and evaluated for accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, build and train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy in classifying images of cats and dogs. The evaluation results and example predictions are provided in the notebook.
